What is DuckSauce?
Simply put DuckSauce is a web application tool and the goal of this tool is to be transparent with existing applications. Much of this tool is built with projects already created so it saves me time. I do not own, claim to have built them. I am simply trying to bring them altogether in such a way that is helpful for my productivity.
